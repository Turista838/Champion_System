# Champion_System

### Project developed for 'Operative Systems', a second year subject @ISEC

Made in collaboration with another student

### This project was developed in a virtual machine using LINUX (does not work in Windows)

#### Guide:

This project consists of a game championship management system called Champion, where the basic concept of such an ongoing system involves a referee (system administrator), several players (called clients and it is mandatory to be at least 2) and one or more games. All games are singleplayer, that is, there are no players directly competing against each other. Communication between games and players is done through the referee. He also has the power to select messages from players and act upon their request, as well as administrator commands. At the end of the championship, all games are over and each player receives his score. These can then return to play in a new league if they wish.<br/>
You need to lauch the arbitro.c first, and then the client.c

#### Commands:
